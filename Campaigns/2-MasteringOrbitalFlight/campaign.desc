To reach this goal the development of a new program named \"Project Apollo\" was started.\r\n\r\nProject Mercury successfully met its goals of sending astronauts into Earth orbit, and returning them safely back to Earth. Building on its success, a new spacecraft has been developed to further learn and understand how orbital flight works. The program is named \"Project Gemini\".\r\n\r\nBefore sending anyone to the Moon, we need to learn everything needed to do so, and test it. Gemini's objective is to understand and test the space travel techniques needed to support the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the Moon.\r\n\r\nA Lunar Mission needs us to survive in space for up to 14 days, understand the methods of performing extra-vehicular activity (EVA), and the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve rendezvous and docking with another spacecraft.",

Two different types of joysticks provide control of the spacecraft in both yaw, pitch roll, and translational axes (forward, backward, up, down, and sideways).

Martin, the Director of Flight Crew Operation has assigned a newly hired astronaut named Aaron Skye as your co-pilot.\r\n\r\nBefore jumping into your first Gemini flight, it's time to visit the Academy again to get the Gemini License. The Gemini Academy can be found in the \"ACADEMY\" section of the Main Menu and will take you through everything you need to know about this brand-new spacecraft. It's recommended to take a copy of the Reentry Gemini Flight Manual with you to the Academy so you can learn the theory and get a deeper understanding of the spacecraft. The tasks ahead will be complicated, and you will be one of the first to solve them.\r\n\r\nOptional: Once you have completed and received the Gemini Pilot Certificate, let your fellow astronauts know in the Official Reentry Discord group, where many of the other Gemini astronauts hang out.

However, the docking objective was met, and Patrick commanded the final Gemini flight with no incidents. This means all the objectives of Project Gemini has been met, and focus has shifted to the Apollo program. Patrick has been scheduled for the first Apollo flight, and all efforts are being done to make sure the Apollo Command Module is ready in time. Your success in Gemini, and the ability to solve problems as they arise has made you one of the most famous astronauts, and naturally, you have been assigned a seat in the Apollo program."
