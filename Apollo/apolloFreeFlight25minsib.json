  "Description": "This is a very early access version of the Saturn IB and Skylab testing mission used during development and testing. If you have the spirit of a Test Pilot, be sure to give it a go!",
  "BriefingText": "This is a development mission for the Test Pilots and is used for testing the Saturn IB (SIB), the Milkstool and rendezvous with Skylab.\nSIB/Skylab is currently an alpha-feature made available as a preview. A lot of work still remains.\n\nIf you have the spirit of a Test Pilot, be sure to give it a try!\n\n\nExpectations:\nThis is a very hard mission so please be ready to fail the rendezvous, or spend time and fuel on closing in with Skylab after the rendezvous.\n\nI recommend you do be familiar and skilled with docking through Project Gemini and its Agena missions, as well as having completed the Command Module Academy/Campaign before attempting this mission. It also helps to be familiar with the transposition and docking procedures when extracting the Lunar Module from the SIVB.\n\nIn development:\n- Dedicated Saturn IB boost checklist (currently you need to use the normal Boost checklist)\n- Ascent guidance to insert you closer to target inclination and a circular orbit (currently you need to circulate the orbit after insertion)\n- Save/Load state support\n- Undocking\n- Better rendezvous burn (currently you might have to work hard to approach and get into formation flying with Skylab)\n- Beacon lights and improved docking lights to make it easier to locate Skylab (currently you need to search for it after the final burns. Used the EMS ranging feature to help you)\n- MOCR: SIB booster monitoring channel\n\nHow to rendezvous and dock with Skylab:\n1) After insertion, complete the insertion checklists to configure the Command/Service Module for orbital mission.\n\n2) Execute a P30/P40 maneuver to circulate the orbit at Apogee.\n\n3) When you are in a circular orbit, use the Crew Members -> Request PADs -> P30 Maneuver: Rendezvous with Skylab to request a rendezvous burn.\n\n4) After the rendezvous burn, request a Circulate at Apogee burn to match your orbit with Skylab. \n\n5) Extend the docking probe, and once extended, set it to retract\n\n6) Close in on the target. It can be hard to see it and the burns you executed decides how close you are to it\n\n7) Use the skills from Project Gemini to close in with Skylab and align yourself with it\n\n8) Use formation flying to inspect Skylab\n\n9) Align yourself with either Skylab docking port 1 or Docking port 2.\n\n10) Align the docking port with the Command Module COAS\n\n11) Finalize the docking\n\n12) Retract the docking probe by setting retract to PRIM 1.\n\n\nGood luck - I will do my best to keep improving this after the 1.0 release.",
