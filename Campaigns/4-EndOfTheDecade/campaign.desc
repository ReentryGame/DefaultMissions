The first manned missions to space happened 8 years ago, with a promise of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. A lot has happened since then. We have seen leaps technical advancements, tragic losses and big achievements. Both the Mercury and the Gemini program has paved the way to get where we are today.","Value":0},{"Type":0,"Data":"The Lunar Module","Value":0},{"Type":1,"Data":"The Lunar Module is complete, and has been tested in subsequent missions since your last mission. It has succeeded all the tests in both Earth and Lunar orbit. The final task remains: The Lunar Landing.","Value":0},{"Type":1,"Data":"The journey to the Moon is long, and a lot of critical steps will take place. Three astronauts will make the journey in the Command & Service module.

One is called the Ascent Stage and is the pressurized part of the spacecraft where the astronauts are operating the spacecraft from. The Descent Stage is the orange lower stage with the landing legs and a big descent engine used to land on the Moon. The ascent stage will serparate from the Descent Stage during liftoff from the Lunar surface. The Descent Stage becomes the launch pad for the ascent stage. The ascent stage has a dedicated ascent engine that will take it from the surface and into an orbit around the Moon.","Value":0},{"Type":2,"Data":"800px-LM_illustration_02.png","Value":0},{"Type":0,"Data":"The Descent Stage","Value":0},{"Type":1,"Data":"The descent stage contains the descent engine, and two fuel and oxidizer tanks used by it.

The rendezvous radar is used during ascent to track the CSM, and during docking for ranging. Four RCS quads are located on the exterior used for attitude and translational control. Comm radios are also located on the roof, as well as a docking target used by the CSM when docking with the LM. Ascent batteries are also located in the ascent module, and is used to power it after the descent stage is separated.","Value":0},{"Type":0,"Data":"Controls and Displays","Value":0},{"Type":2,"Data":"LM-CB11-16lbl.png","Value":0},{"Type":1,"Data":"The Lunar Module is operated through the control panels, attitude control sticks and translation control sticks. A guidance computer, similar to the one located in the CSM, is used for guidance, and is referred to as the Lunar Guidance Computer (LGC). Two astronauts will operate the spacecraft standing. A hatch above their heads are used to get in and out of the Lunar Module when docked with the CSM, and a forward hatch is used to get in and out when on the lunar surface.","Value":0},{"Type":0,"Data":"The Crew","Value":0},{"Type":1,"Data":"Martin, the Director of Flight Crew Operation has made you a Commander of the Lunar Landing mission.
