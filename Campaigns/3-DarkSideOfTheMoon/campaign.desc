Lodkins has been training for his first trip to space. and will join your crew as the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP).\r\n\r\nA lot of pressure is upon us if we are to succeed of landing on the Moon in this decade. It is therefore vital that each and every Apollo mission leading to the Lunar Landing is a success.\r\n\r\nYou are scheduled for the Apollo Command Module Academy to being training immediately. Before attempting this campaign, you should get the Command Module Pilot certificate. The Academy can be found in the \"ACADEMY\" section of the Main Menu, and will take you through everything you need to know about the spacecraft to command a mission.\r\n\r\nOther astronauts who has gone through the Academy can also be found in the Official Reentry Discord group. Learning this thing is hard by yourself, so reach out to get help!\r\nHead to: discord.gg/reentrygame to find us!\r\n\r\nOptional: Once you have completed and received the Command Module Pilot Certificate, let your fellow astronauts know so you can get the Apollo Command Module Community Badge too.",
