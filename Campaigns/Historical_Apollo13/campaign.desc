Lovell, Jr.; command module pilot Thomas K. Mattingly III, and lunar module pilot Fred W. Haise, Jr.\r\n\r\nHowever, two days before launch, Jack Swigert, who originally was on the backup crew for Apollo 13, was promoted to the primary crew due to command module pilot Mattingly being exposed to German measles.",

Real audio is used to an extent, and the mission is mostly a sequential execution of events.\r\n\r\nThe journey has been split up into multiple missions, each lasting between 30 minutes to 2 hours.\r\n\r\nEach chapter will provide you with all of the checklists needed. They will be made available in the Mission Pad when required, and some procedures will be executed with Mission Control. Some chapters will ask you to use the Flight Documents (SHIFT+M) to open the real flight plan and checklists used by the crew.\r\n\r\nThis is a complex mission with a lot of moving parts, and to make it possible for you to experience this mission in Reentry, I have designed maneuvers and procedures to make them part of the campaign even if the procedure isn't directly supported/simulated in the game.\r\n",
