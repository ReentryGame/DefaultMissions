    "BriefingText": "BRIEFING\r\n\r\nPreparing the Atlas for launch is the same procedure are in Redstone (Lesson 1 and 2). The ascent is slightly different as there are an additional half-stage that needs to separate before tower launch and the final ascent before capsule separation. The ascent also takes 5 minutes to reach orbital speed.\r\n\r\nCHECKLIST SYSTEM\r\nThe checklist system has been designed to provide you with all the checklists needed to fly and operate the spacecrafts in Reentry. All checklists are available from the CHECKLISTS tab of the Mission Pad. The checklist page has a few sections (headers such as ASCENT) used to categorize checklists.\r\nYou can open a checklists by clicking on it. This will show the checklist text, and you can start reading through it. You can use M to toggle the mission pad while you perform a checklist, or drag the checklist to the side of the window to give some more realestate to the panel, so you can work with it side-by-side.\r\n\r\nMost checklists has a RUN button and a BACK button. BACK will bring you back to the checklist selection. RUN will allow a checklist guide system to help you through it. A switch highlighter will walk you through the checklist, highlighting out-of-place switches. The UI will show that step in the checklist you are at, and what switch needs attention.\r\nIn the Checklist Guide UI, the top line is the current checklist step needing attention, and the following lines are the queue of the next checklist items waiting for their turn. On the top line, the PRO button is short for PROCEED, and will tell the checklist system to move to the next line in the queue, completing the current line.\r\n\r\nBy default, the checklist system is configured to automatically proceed to the next line when a switch is placed to the correct position (basically pressing PRO for you). You can disable this autoproceed feature from the REALISM SETTINGS. If disabled, switched in the correct position will be highlighted in green, and you need to press PRO to continue.\r\n\r\nThere are two different checklist lines. One is a check to see if a control is in the correct position (such as a switch needed to be set to the UP position), or a fuse that needs to be closed.\r\nAnother type are manual steps. These steps are usually instructional (such as Perform a Radio Check, set up system X, ensure an instruments reads something). These lines have a flashing blue and green backdrop in the Checklist Guide UI. You need to manually press PRO to continue.\r\n\r\nThe Checklist Guide UI PRO button has a bindable hot-key to it, and is by default assinged to the keyboard button [T]. Pressing [T] will proceed the checklist to the next item in line.",
